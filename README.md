# CSCI-272-Rational
The purpose of this project is to create a class called <i> Rational </i> for performing arithmetic with fractions. The program has integer variables to represent the private data of the class and a constructor that initializes an object when it's declared. In addition, it has public member functions that performs each of the following tasks.
<ul> <li> Add two Rational numbers. 
<li> Subtract two Rational numbers. 
<li> Multiple two Rational numbers. 
<li> Divide two Rational numbers. 
<li> Print the Rational numbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator. 
<li> Print the Rational numbers in floating-point form
</ul>

Note: All results were stored in reduced form and Operator Overloading was used in the program.
